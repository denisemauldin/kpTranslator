# kpTranslator
OpenAPI for NCATS Biomedical Translator Reasoners

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
docker-compose up
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/openapi.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Database

To create the test database, start the server and run

```
docker-compose exec kp-translator python scripts/build_database.py
```

This was generated using a modified TranslatorReasonersAPI.yaml that does not include the oneOf type definitions.

### Knowledge Graph Exchange (KGX) File Ingest (In Development)

To populate the database from KGX-formatted flat files (see 
[Data preparation for use with KGX](https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx/blob/master/data-preparation.md)), run the
build_database.py script with the --db_config flag as follows

```
docker-compose exec kp-translator python scripts/build_database.py --db_config data/db_config_file.json
```

The contents of the configuration file (located in a 'data' subfolder in the above example) should look like this

```
{
    "dataset1": 
    {
        "source_dir": "source-data-folder",
        "nodes_file": "source-data-nodes.tsv",
        "edges_file": "source-data-edges.tsv"
    }
}
```

In this example, the nodes and edges files, denoted by "nodes_file" and "edges_file" should be located in the
subdirectory denoted by "source_dir".
